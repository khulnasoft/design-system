## 4.10.0

### Updated

`AppFrame`
- Modified sticky/fixed position to turn off when viewport height is under 480px in height.
- Refactored styles to make `AppFrame` responsible for sticky/fixed layout of `SideNav`.

`AppFrame::Main`

- Added `id` with default value of "kds-main" which the `SideNav` `a11yRefocusSkipTo` argument points to.
